Large parallel computers can be used in two different ways. In later
chapters you will see how scientific problems can be scaled up almost
arbitrarily. This means that with an increasing need for accuracy or
scale, increasingly large computers are needed. The use of a whole
machine for a single problem, with only time-to-solution as the
measure of success, is known as \indexterm{capability computing}.

On the other hand, many problems need less than a whole supercomputer
to solve, so typically a computing center will set up a machine so
that it serves a continuous stream of user problems, each
smaller than the full machine. In this mode, the measure of success is
the sustained performance per unit cost. This is known as
\indexterm{capacity computing}, and it requires a finely tuned job
scheduling strategy. This topic, while interesting, is not further
discussed in this book.
