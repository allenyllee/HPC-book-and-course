  Iterative methods are typically used for sparse matrices. In that
  context, you can argue that the communication involved in an inner product
  can have a larger influence on overall performance than the
  communication in the matrix-vector product. What is the
  complexity of the matrix-vector product and the inner product as a
  function of the number of processors?
