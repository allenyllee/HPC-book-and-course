  Consider the limit case where processors are infinitely fast and
  bandwidth between processors is also unlimited. What is the sole
  remaining factor determining the runtime? What graph problem do you
  need to solve now to find the optimal load balance? What property of
  a sparse matrix gives the worst case behaviour?
