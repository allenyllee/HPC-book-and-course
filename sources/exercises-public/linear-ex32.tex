  Prove the following statements.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Assume that the matrix $A$ has a
    \indexterm{halfbandwidth}~$p$, that is, $a_{ij}=0$ if
    $|i-j|>p$. Show that, after a factorization without pivoting,
    $L+U$ has the same halfbandwidth.
  \item Show that, after a factorization with partial pivoting,
    $L$~has a left halfbandwidth of~$p$, whereas $U$~has a
    right halfbandwidth of~$2p$.
  \item Assuming no pivoting, show that the fill-in can be
    characterized as follows:
    \begin{quote}
      Consider row~$i$. Let $j_{\min}$ be the leftmost nonzero in
      row~$i$, that is $a_{ij}=0$ for $j<j_{\min}$. Then there will be
      no fill-in in row~$i$ to the left of
      column~$j_{\min}$. Likewise, if $i_{\min}$ is the topmost
      nonzero in column~$j$, there will be no fill-in in column~$j$
      above row~$i_{\min}$.
    \end{quote}
    As a result, $L$~and~$U$ have a `skyline' profile. Given a sparse
    matrix, it is now easy to allocate enough storage to fit a
    factorization without pivoting: this is knows as
    \indexterm{skyline storage}.
  \end{enumerate}
