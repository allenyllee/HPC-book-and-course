  The listing has a call to \n{VecSet} to set the vector elements to a
  constant value. Remove this line.
  Use the \n{myfirst,mylast} variables and the PETSc routine
  \n{VecSetValue} to let every process set its
  local vector elements to the processor number. (The last argument of
  \n{VecSetValue} should be \n{INSERT_VALUES}.) That is, if the
  vector is six elements long and there are three processors, the
  resulting vector should be $(0,0,1,1,2,2)$.
