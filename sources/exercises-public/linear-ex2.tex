  Suppose you want to exchange matrix rows 2 and 3 of the system of
  equations in equation~\eqref{eq:systemabbrev}. What other
  adjustments would you have to make to make sure you still compute the
  correct solution?
  Continue the system solution of the previous exercse
  by exchanging rows 2 and~3, and check that you get the correct answer.
