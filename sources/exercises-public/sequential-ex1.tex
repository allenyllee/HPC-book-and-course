  Let us compare the speed of a classical \ac{FPU}, and a pipelined
  one. Show that the result rate is now dependent on~$n$: give a
  formula for $r(n)$, and for
  $r_\infty=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}r(n)$. What is the asymptotic
  improvement in $r$ over the non-pipelined case?

  Next you can wonder how long it takes to get close to the asymptotic
  behaviour. Show that for $n=n_{1/2}$ you get $r(n)=r_\infty/2$.
  This is often used as the definition of~$n_{1/2}$.
