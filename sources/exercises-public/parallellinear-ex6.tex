  Show that a one-dimensional partitioning of the domain leads to a
  partitioning of the matrix into block rows, but a two-dimensional
  partitioning of the domain does not. You can do this in the
  abstract, or you can illustrate it: take a $4\times4$ domain (giving
  a matrix of size~16), and partition it over 4 processors. The
  one-dimensional domain partitioning corresponds to giving each
  processor one line out of the domain, while the two-dimensional
  partitioning gives each processor a $2\times2$ subdomain. Draw the
  matrices for these two cases.
