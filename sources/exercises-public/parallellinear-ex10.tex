  Give a formal analysis of the speedup and efficiency of the \ac{BEM}
  algorithm. Assume again a unit amount of work~$w$ per processor and
  a time of communication~$c$ per neighbour. Since the notion of
  neighbour is now based on physical distance, not on graph
  properties, the number of neighbours will go up. Give
  $T_1,T_p,S_p,E_p$ for this case.
