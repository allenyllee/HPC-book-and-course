  Now consider a $4\times4$ matrix and a $2\times2$ processor
  grid. Distribute the matrix cyclicly both by rows and columns. Show
  how the matrix-vector product can again be performed using the
  contiguous matrix storage, as long as the input is distributed
  correctly. How is the output distributed? Show that more
  communication is needed than the reduction of the one-dimensional
  example.
