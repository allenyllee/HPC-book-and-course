  We would like to show that the block algorithm here again computes
  the same result as the scalar one. Doing so by looking explicitly at
  the computed elements is cumbersome, so we take another
  approach.  First, recall from section~\ref{sec:LUunique} that $LU$ factorizations are unique: if
  $A=L_1U_1=L_2U_2$ and $L_1,L_2$ have unit diagonal, then $L_1=L_2$,
  $U_1=U_2$.

  Next, consider the computation of $A_{kk}\inv$. Show that this can
  be done easily by first computing an LU factorization
  of~$A_{kk}$. Now use this to show that the block LU factorization
  can give $L$ and $U$ factors that are strictly triangular. The
  uniqueness of $LU$ factorizations then proves that the block
  algorithm computes the scalar result.
