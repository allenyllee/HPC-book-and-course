  There are more algorithms for computing the product $C\leftarrow
  A\cdot B$. Consider the following:
\begin{verbatim}
for k=1..n:
  for i=1..n:
    for j=1..n:
      c[i,j] += a[i,k]*b[k,j]
\end{verbatim}
Analyze the memory traffic for the matrix~$C$, and show that it is
worse than the two algorithms given above.
