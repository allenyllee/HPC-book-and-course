  Multiplying matrices is harder than multiplying a matrix times a
  vector. If matrix $A$ has left and halfbandwidth $p_A,q_Q$, and
  matrix $B$ has $p_B,q_B$, what are the left and right halfbandwidth
  of $C=AB$? Assuming that an array of sufficient size has been
  allocated for~$C$, write a routine that computes $C\leftarrow AB$.
