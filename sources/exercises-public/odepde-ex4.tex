  The block structure of the matrix, with all diagonal blocks having
  the same size, is due to the fact that we defined our \ac{BVP} on a
  square domain. Sketch the matrix structure that arises from
  discretizing equation~\eqref{eq:laplace}, again with central
  differences, but this time defined on a triangular domain; see
  figure~\ref{fig:laplacetriangle}. Show that, again, there is a block
  tridiagonal matrix structure, but that the blocks are now of varying
  sizes. Hint: start by sketching a small example. For $n=4$ you
  should get a $10\times 10$ matrix with a $4\times 4$ block structure.
