  Consider the `arrow' matrix with nonzeroes only
  in the first row and column and on the diagonal:
  \[
  \begin{pmatrix}
    *&*&\cdots&*\\ *&*&&\emptyset\\ \vdots&&\ddots\\ *&\emptyset&&*
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  What is the number of nonzeros in the matrix, and in the
  factorization, assuming that no addition ever results in zero? Can
  you find a symmetric permutation of the variables of the problem
  such that the new matrix has no fill-in?
