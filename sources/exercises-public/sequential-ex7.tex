  In the example of direct mapped caches, mapping from memory to cache
  was done by using the final 16 bits of a 32 bit memory address as
  cache address. Show that the problems in this example go away if the
  mapping is done by using the first (`most significant') 16 bits as
  the cache address. Why is this not a good solution in general?
