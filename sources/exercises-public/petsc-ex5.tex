  In addition to setting the diagonal, also set the first
  subdiagonal and the first superdiagonal, that is, the elements
  $(i,i-1)$ and $(i,i+1)$. To set all three elements in a row with one
  call you can do this:
\begin{verbatim}
vm = 1.*mytid;
for (i=myfirst; i<mylast; i++) {
  PetscInt j[3]; PetscReal v[3];
  j[0] = i-1; j[1] = i; j[2] = i+1;
  v[0] = --vm-1; v[1] = 2*vm; v[2] = -vm+1;
  ierr = MatSetValues(A,1,&i,3,j,v,INSERT_VALUES); CHKERRQ(ierr);
}
\end{verbatim}
However, this code is not entirely correct. Edit the program using
this fragment and run it. Diagnose the problem and fix it.
