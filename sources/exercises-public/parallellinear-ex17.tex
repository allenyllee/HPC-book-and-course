  In section~\ref{sec:lu-graph} you saw the connection between LU
  factorization and graph theory: eliminating a node leads to a graph
  with that node removed, but with certain new connections added.
  Show that, after eliminating the
  first two sets of variables, the graph of the remaining matrix on
  the separator will be fully connected.
