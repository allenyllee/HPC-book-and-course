Traditional scientific computing applications concern continuous data,
often stemming from \acp{PDE}. In this chapter we will concern two
applications areas, sorting and graph computations, that are not
traditionally considered as scientific computing, but that are
interesting from a point of high performance and large scale computing.

\Level 0 {Sorting}
\Level 0 {Graph analytics}
