Another important topic in high performance computers is their power
consumption. Here
we need to distinguish between the power consumption of a single
processor chip, and that of a complete cluster.

As the number of components on a chip grows, its power consumption
would also grow. Fortunately, in a counter acting trend,
miniaturization of the chip features has simultaneously been reducing
the necessary power. Suppose that the feature size~$\lambda$ (think:
thickness of wires) is scaled down to $s\lambda$ with~$s<1$. In order
to keep the electric field in the transistor constant, the length and
width of the channel, the oxide thickness, substrate concentration
density and the operating voltage are all scaled by the same factor.

\Level 1 {Derivation of scaling properties}

The properties of \emph{constant field scaling}\index{field scaling} or
\indexterm{Dennard scaling}~\cite{Bohr:30yearDennard,Dennard:scaling}
are an ideal-case description of the properties of a circuit
as it is miniaturized. One important result is that power density 
stays constant as chip features get smaller, and the frequency 
is simultaneously increased. 

The basic properties derived from circuit theory are that,
if we scale feature size down by~$s$:
\[
\begin{array}{|l|c|}\hline
\hbox{Feature size}&\sim s\\
\hbox{Voltage}&\sim s\\
\hbox{Current}&\sim s \\ 
\hbox{Frequency}&\sim s\\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Then we can derive that 
\[ \hbox{Power} = V\cdot I \sim s^2, \]
and because the total size of the circuit also goes down with~$s^2$,
the power density stays the same.
Thus, it also becomes possible to
put more transistors on a circuit, and essentially not change the cooling
problem.

This result can be considered
the driving force behind \indexterm{Moore's law},
which states that the number of transistors in a processor
doubles every 18 months.

The frequency-dependent part of the power a processor needs
comes from charging and discharing the capacitance of the circuit, so
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{|l|l|} \hline
\hbox{Charge}&q=CV\\
\hbox{Work}&W=qV=CV^2\\
\hbox{Power}&W/\hbox{time}=WF=CV^2F \\ \hline
\end{array}
\label{eq:power}
\end{equation}
This analysis can be used to justify the introduction of multicore processors.

\Level 1 {Multicore}

At the time of this writing (circa~2010), miniaturization of
components has almost come to a standstill, because further lowering
of the voltage would give prohibitive leakage. Conversely, the
frequency can not be scaled up since this would raise the heat
production of the chip too far.

Figure~\ref{fig:chipheat} gives a dramatic illustration of the heat
that a chip would give off, if single-processor trends had
continued.

One conclusion is that computer design
is running into a \indextermbus{power}{wall}, where the sophistication
of a single core can not be increased any further (so we can for
instance no longer increase \indexac{ILP} and
\indextermbus{pipeline}{depth}) and the only way to increase
performance is to increase the amount of explicitly visible
parallelism. This development has led to the current generation of
\indexterm{multicore} processors; see section~\ref{sec:multicore}. It
is also the reason \acp{GPU} with their simplified processor design
and hence lower energy consumption
are attractive; the same holds for \acp{FPGA}.
One solution to the power wall problem is introduction
of \emph{multicore}\index{multicore!motivated by power} processors.
Recall equation~\ref{eq:power}, and compare a single processor to two 
processors at half the frequency. That should have the same computing power, right?
Since we lowered the frequency, we can lower the voltage if we stay with the same 
process technology.

The total electric power for the two processors (cores) is, ideally,
\[ \left.
\begin{array}{c}
C_{\mathrm{multi}} = 2C\\
F_{\mathrm{multi}} = F/2\\
V_{\mathrm{multi}} = V/2\\
\end{array}\right\} \Rightarrow
P_{\mathrm{multi}} = P/4.
\]
In practice the capacitance will go up by a little over~2, and the
voltage can not quite be dropped by~2, so it is more likely that
$P_{\mathrm{multi}} \approx 0.4\times
P$~\cite{Chandrakasa:transformations}.  Of course the integration
aspects are a little more complicated in
practice~\cite{Bohr:ISSCC2009}; the important conclusion is that now,
in order to lower the power (or, conversely, to allow further increase
in performance while keeping the power constant) we now have to start
programming in parallel.

\Level 1 {Total computer power}

The total power consumption of a parallel computer is determined by
the consumption per processor and the number of processors in the full
machine. At present, this is commonly several Megawatts. By the above
reasoning, the increase in power needed from increasing the number of
processors can no longer be offset by more power-effective processors,
so power is becoming the overriding consideration as parallel
computers move from the petascale (attained in 2008 by the
\indextermbus{IBM}{Roadrunner}) to a projected exascale.

In the most recent generations of processors, power is becoming an
overriding consideration, with influence in unlikely places. For
instance, the \ac{SIMD} design of processors (see
section~\ref{sec:simd}, in particular section~\ref{sec:sse-avx}) is
dictated by the power cost of instruction decoding.
