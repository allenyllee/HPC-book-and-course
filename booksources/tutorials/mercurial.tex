\Level 0 {Mercurial (hg) and Git}
\index{mercurial|(}
\index{hg|see{mercurial}}
\index{git|(}

\emph{Mercurial} and \emph{git} are the best known of a new generation
of \indextermsub{distributed}{source code control} systems. Many
commands are the same as for subversion, but there are some new
ones, corresponding to the new level of sophistication.
Mercurial and git share some commands, but there are also differences.
Git is ultimately more powerful, but mercurial is easier to use at first.

Here is a translation between the two systems:
\url{https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Git-hg-rosetta-stone}.

Minimal introduction to git: \url{http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/}

This lab should be done two people, to simulate a group
of programmers working on a joint project. You can also do this on
your own by using two clones of the repository, 
preferably opening two windows on your computer.

Best practices for distributed version control:
\url{https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/version-control.html}

\Level 1 {Create and populate a repository}

\begin{purpose}
  In this section you will create a repository and make a local copy
  to work on.
\end{purpose}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
  \hline
  mercurial&git\\
  \hline
  \n{hg clone <url> [ localdir ]}&
  \n{git clone <url> [ localdir ]}\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

First we need to have a repository. In practice, you will often use
one that has been previousy set up, but there are several ways to
set up a repository yourself.
There are commercial and free hosting services such as
  \url{http://bitbucket.org}. (Academic users can have more private
  repositories.)

Let's assume that one student has created a repository \n{your-project}
on Bitbucket. Both students can then clone it:
\begin{verbatim}
%% hg clone https://YourName@bitbucket.org/YourName/your-project
updating to branch default
0 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 
    0 files unresolved
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
%% git clone git@bitbucket.org:YourName/yourproject.git
Cloning into 'yourproject'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
\end{verbatim}
You now have an empty directory \n{your-project}.

\practical{Go into the project directory and see if it is really
  empty.}{There is a hidden directory \n{.hg} or \n{.git}}{}

\Level 1 {New files}
\label{sec:hg-push}

\heading{Creating an untracked file}

\begin{purpose}
  In this section you will make some simple changes:
  creating a new file
  and
  editing an existing file
\end{purpose}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
  \hline
  mercurial&git\\
  \hline
  \n{hg status [ path] }&
  \n{git status [ path ]}\\
  \n{hg add [ files ] }&
  \n{git add [ files ]}\\
  once for each file&every time the file is changed\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

One student now makes a file to add to the repository:
\begin{verbatim}
%%  cat > firstfile
a
b
c
d
e
f
^D
\end{verbatim}
(where \verb+^D+ stands for control-D, which terminates the input.)
This file is unknown to \n{hg}:
\begin{verbatim}
%% hg status
? firstfile
\end{verbatim}
Git is a little more verbose:
\begin{verbatim}
git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

firstfile

nothing added to commit but untracked files present
  (use "git add" to track)
\end{verbatim}

\heading{Adding the file to the repository}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \includegraphics[scale=.4]{git-push}
  \caption{Add local changes to the remote repository}
  \label{fig:git-push}
\end{figure}

We need to declare the file as belonging to the repository; a
subsequent \n{hg commit} command then copies it into the repository.
\begin{verbatim}
%% hg add firstfile 
%% hg status
A firstfile
%% hg commit -m "made a first file"
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
%% git add firstfile
%% git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   firstfile
%% git commit -a -m "adding a first file"
  [master (root-commit) f4b738c] adding a first file
  1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)
  create mode 100644 firstfile
\end{verbatim}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
  \hline
  mercurial&git\\
  \hline
  \n{hg commit -m <message>}&
  \n{git commit -m <message>}\\
  \n{hg push}&
  \n{git push origin master}\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

Unlike with Subversion, the file has now only been copied into the 
local repository, so that you can, for instance, roll back your
changes. If you want this file added to the master repository,
you need the \n{hg push} command:
\begin{verbatim}
%% hg push https://YourName@bitbucket.org/YourName/your-project
pushing to https://YourName@bitbucket.org/YourName/your-project
searching for changes
remote: adding changesets
remote: adding manifests
remote: adding file changes
remote: added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files
remote: bb/acl: YourName is allowed. accepted payload.
\end{verbatim}
In the \n{push} step you were probably asked for your password. You can
prevent that by having some lines in your \verb+$HOME/.hgrc+ file:
{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
[paths]
projectrepo = https://YourName:yourpassword@bitbucket.org/YourName/my-project
[ui]
username=Your Name <you@somewhere.youruniversity.edu>
\end{verbatim}
}
Now the command \n{hg push projectrepo} will push the local changes
to the global repository without asking for your password. Of course,
now you have a file with a cleartext password, so you should set the
permissions of this file correctly.

With git you need to be more explicit, since the ties between your
local copy and the `upstream' repository can be more fluid.
\begin{verbatim}
git remote add origin git@bitbucket.org:YourName/yourrepo.git
git push origin master
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \includegraphics[scale=.4]{git-pull}
  \caption{Get changes that were made to the remote repository}
  \label{fig:git-pull}
\end{figure}

The second student now needs to update their repository. Just like the
upload took two commands, this pass also takes two. First you do \n{hg
  pull} to update your local repository. This does not update the
local files you have: for that you need to do \n{hg update}.

\practical{Do this and check that the contents of the file are
  correct.}{In order to do the update command, you have to be in a
  checked-out copy of the repository.}

\practical{Let both students create a new directory with a few
  files. Declare the directory and commit it. Pull and update to
  obtain the changes the other mde.}{You can do \n{hg add} on the
  directory, this will also add the files contained in it.}{}

Since you will mostly be doing an update immediately after a pull, you
can combine them:
\begin{verbatim}
hg pull -u
\end{verbatim}
Git will report what files are updated; for Hg you need to take the
changeset number and query:
\begin{verbatim}
hg status --change 82ffb99c79fd
\end{verbatim}

\begin{remark}
  In order for Mercurial to keep track of your files, you should never do
  the shell commands
  \n{cp} or \n{mv} on files that are in the repository. Instead, do
  \n{hg cp} or \n{hg mv}. Likewise, there is a command \n{hg rm}.
\end{remark}

\Level 1 {Oops! Undo!}

One of the reasons for having source code control is to be able to
revert changes. The easiest undo is to go back to the last stored
version in the repository.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
  \hline
  mercurial&git\\
  \hline
  \n{hg revert <yourfile>}&
  \n{git checkout -- <yourfile>}\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

\Level 1 {Conflicts}

\begin{purpose}
  In this section you will learn about how do deal with conflicting
  edits by two users of the same repository.
\end{purpose}

Now let's see what happens when two people edit the same file.
Let both students make an edit to \verb+firstfile+, but one to the
top, the other to the bottom. After one student commits the edit, the
other can commit changes, after all, these only affect the local repository.
However, trying to push that change gives an error:
\begin{verbatim}
%% emacs firstfile # make some change
%% hg commit -m ``first again''
%% hg push test
abort: push creates new remote head b0d31ea209b3!
(you should pull and merge or use push -f to force)
\end{verbatim}
The solution is to get the other edit, and commit again. This takes a 
couple of commands:
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
%% hg pull myproject
searching for changes
adding changesets
adding manifests
adding file changes
added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files (+1 heads)
(run 'hg heads' to see heads, 'hg merge' to merge)

%% hg merge
merging firstfile
0 files updated, 1 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
(branch merge, don't forget to commit)

%% hg status
M firstfile
%% hg commit -m ``my edit again''
%% hg push test
pushing to https://VictorEijkhout:***@bitbucket.org/
                       VictorEijkhout/my-project
searching for changes
remote: adding changesets
remote: adding manifests
remote: adding file changes
remote: added 2 changesets with 2 changes to 1 files
remote: bb/acl: VictorEijkhout is allowed. accepted payload.
\end{verbatim}
}

This may seem complicated, but you see that Mercurial prompts you 
for what commands to execute, and the workflow is clear, if you refer
to figure~\ref{fig:hg}.

\practical{Do a \n{cat} on the file that both of you have been editing.
You should find that both edits are incorporated. That is the `merge'
that Mercurial referred to.}{}{}

If both students make edits on the same part of the file, version
control can no
longer resolve the conflicts. For instance, let one student insert a
line between the first and the second, and let the second student edit
the second line. Whoever tries to push second, will get messages
like this:
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
%% hg pull test
added 3 changesets with 3 changes to 1 files (+1 heads)
(run 'hg heads' to see heads, 'hg merge' to merge)
%% hg merge
merging firstfile
warning: conflicts during merge.
merging firstfile incomplete! 
    (edit conflicts, then use 'hg resolve --mark')
0 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 1 files unresolved
use 'hg resolve' to retry unresolved file merges 
    or 'hg update -C .' to abandon
\end{verbatim}
}
There are now the following options:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is usually a way to indicate whether to use the local or
  the remote version.
\item There are graphical programs to resolve conflicts. They will
  typically show you 3 colums, for the two versions, and for your
  resolution. You can then indicate `take this from the local version,
  and this from the remote'.
\item You can also edit the file to resolve the conflicts yourself. We
  will discuss that shortly.
\end{enumerate}

Both  will give you several options. It is easiest to resolve the
conflict with a text editor. If you open the file that has the conflict
you'll see something like:
\begin{verbatim}
<<<<<<< local
aa
bbbb
=======
aaa
a2
b
>>>>>>> other
c
\end{verbatim}
indicating the difference between the local version (`mine') and the
other, that is the version that you pulled and tried to merge.
You need to edit the file to resolve the conflict.

After this, you tell hg that the conflict was resolved:
\begin{verbatim}
 hg resolve --mark
%% hg status
M firstfile
? firstfile.orig
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
git add <name of that file>
\end{verbatim}
After this you can commit and push again.
The other student then needs to do another update to get the
correction.

Not all files can be merged: for binary files Mercurial will ask you:
\begin{verbatim}
%% hg merge
merging proposal.tex
merging summary.tex
merking references.tex
 no tool found to merge proposal.pdf
keep (l)ocal or take (o)ther? o
\end{verbatim}
This means that the only choices are to keep your local version
(type~\n{l} and hit return) or take the other version (type~\n{o} and
hit return). In the case of a binary file that was obvious generated
automatically, some people argue that they should not be in the
repository to begin with.

\Level 1 {Inspecting the history}

\begin{purpose}
  In this section, you will learn how to view and compare files in the
  repository.
\end{purpose}

If you want to know where you cloned a repository from, look in the
file \n{.hg/hgrc}.

The main sources of information about the repository are \n{hg log}
and \n{hg id}. The latter gives you global information, depending
on what option you use. For instance, \n{hg id -n} gives the local revision
number.
\begin{itemize}
\item [\texttt{hg log}] gives you a list of all changesets so far,
  with the comments you entered.
\item [\texttt{hg log -v}] tells you what files were affected in each changeset.
\item [\texttt{hg log -r 5}] or \n{hg log -r 6:8} gives information on
  one or more changesets.
\end{itemize}

To see differences in various revisions of individual files, use
\n{hg diff}. First 
make sure you are up to date. Now do \n{hg diff firstfile}. No
output, right? Now make an edit in \n{firstfile} and do \n{hg diff
  firstfile} again. This gives you the difference between the last
commited version and the working copy.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
  \hline
  mercurial&git\\
  \hline
  \n{hg diff <file>}&
  \n{git diff HEAD <file>}\\
  \n{hg diff -r A -r B <file>}&
  \n{git diff A^..B <file>}\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

Check for yourself what happens when you do a commit but no push, and 
you issue the above diff command.

You can also ask for differences between committed versions with
\n{hg diff -r 4:6 firstfile}.

The output of this diff command is a bit cryptic, but you can
understand it without too much trouble. There are also fancy GUI
implementations of hg for every platform that show you differences in
a much nicer way.

If you simply want to see what a file used to look like, do \n{hg
  cat -r 2 firstfile}. To get a copy of a certain revision of the
repository, do \n{hg export -r 3 . ../rev3}, which exports the
repository at the current directory (`dot') to the directory \n{../rev3}.

If you save the output of \n{hg diff}, it is possible to apply it
with the Unix \n{patch} command. This is a quick way to send patches
to someone without them needing to check out the repository.

\begin{notready}
  \Level 1 {Multiple versions}

  See what branches there are: \n{hg brances}

  See what branch you are working on: \n{hg branch}

  Swith to a branch (this undoes local changes): \n{hg update -C branchname}
\end{notready}

\Level 1 {Transport}

Mercurial and git can use either \texttt{ssh} or \texttt{http} as
\indexterm{transport}%
\index{ssh!as transport}%
\index{http!as transport}.
With Git you may need to redefine the transport for a \texttt{push}:
\begin{verbatim}
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:TACC/pylauncher.git
\end{verbatim}

\index{mercurial|)}
\index{git|)}
