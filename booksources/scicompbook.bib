	MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation
	for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify a map
	function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate
	key/value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate
	values associated with the same intermediate key. Many real world
	tasks are expressible in this model, as shown in the paper.
	
	
	Programs written in this functional style are automatically parallelized
	and executed on a large cluster of commodity machines. The run-time
	system takes care of the details of partitioning the input data,
	scheduling the program's execution across a set of machines, handling
	machine failures, and managing the required inter-machine communication.
	This allows programmers without any experience with parallel and
	distributed systems to easily utilize the resources of a large distributed
	system.
	
	
	Our implementation of MapReduce runs on a large cluster of commodity
	machines and is highly scalable: a typical MapReduce computation
	processes many terabytes of data on thousands of machines. Programmers
	find the system easy to use: hundreds of MapReduce programs have
	been implemented and upwards of one thousand MapReduce jobs are executed
	on Google's clusters every day.},
