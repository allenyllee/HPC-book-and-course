  To arrive at the blocked code, the loop over \n{j} was split into a
  loop over blocks and an inner loop over the elements of the block;
  the outer loop over \n{i} was then exchanged with the loop over the
  blocks. In this particular example you could also simply exchange
  the \n{i} and \n{j} loops. Why may this not be optimal for performance?
