  \label{ex:summing0}
  Assume that an addition takes a certain unit time, and that moving a
  number from one processor to another takes that same unit time. Show
  that the communication time equals the computation time.

  Now assume that sending a number from processor $p$ to $p\pm k$
  takes time~$k$. Show that the execution time of the parallel
  algorithm now is of the same order as the sequential time.
