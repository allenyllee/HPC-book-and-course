  The LAPACK software for dense linear algebra has an LU factorization
  routine that overwrites the input matrix with the factors. Above you
  saw that is possible since the columns of~$L$ are generated
  precisely as the columns of~$A$ are eliminated. Why is such an
  algorithm not possible if the matrix is stored in sparse format?
