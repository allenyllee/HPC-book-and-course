  What is the diameter of this graph? Identify the tasks that lie on
  the path that determines the diameter. What is the meaning of these
  tasks in the context of the algorithm? This path is called the
  \indexterm{critical path}. Its length determines the execution time of the
  computation in parallel, even if an infinite number of processors is
  available.
