  Your parallel computer has its processors organized in a 2D grid.
  The chip manufacturer comes out with a new chip with same clock
  speed that is dual core instead of single core, and that will fit in
  the existing sockets. Critique the following argument: "the amount
  work per second that can be done (that does not involve communication)
  doubles; since the network stays the same, the bisection bandwidth
  also stays the same, so I can reasonably expect my new machine to
  become twice as fast\footnote{With the numbers one and two replaced
    by higher numbers, this is actually not a bad description of
    current trends in processor design.}."
