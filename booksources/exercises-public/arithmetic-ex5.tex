  The number $e\approx 2.72$, the base for the natural logarithm, has
  various definitions. One of them is
  \[ e=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} (1+1/n)^n. \]
  Write a single precision program that tries to compute~$e$ in this
  manner. Evaluate the expression for $n=10^k$ with
  $k=1,\ldots,10$. Explain the output for large~$n$. Comment on the
  behaviour of the error.
