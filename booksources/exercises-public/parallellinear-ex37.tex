  In section~\ref{sec:seq-consist} you learned the concept of
  \indexterm{sequential consistency}: a threaded parallel code program
  should give the same results when executed in parallel as when it's
  executed sequentially. We have just stated that \ac{DAG}-based
  algorithms are free to execute tasks in any order that obeys the
  partial order of the graph nodes. Discuss whether
  sequential consistency is a problem in this context.
