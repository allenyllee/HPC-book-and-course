  Consider the matrix $A$ of equation~\eqref{eq:5starmatrix} that we
  obtained from discretization of a two-dimensional \ac{BVP}. Let $K$
  be matrix containing the diagonal of~$A$, that is $k_{ii}=a_{ii}$
  and $k_{ij}=0$ for~$i\not=j$. Use the Gershgorin theorem to show
  that $|\lambda(I-AK\inv)|<1$.
