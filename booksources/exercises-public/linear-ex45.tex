    Write a simple program to experiment with linear system
    solving. Take the matrix from the 1D BVP (use an efficient storage
    scheme) and program an iterative
    method using the choice $K=D_A$. Experiment with stopping tests on
    the residual and the distance between iterates.
    How does the number of iterations
    depend on the size of the matrix?

    Change the matrix construction so that a certain quantity is
    added the diagonal, that is, add $\alpha I$ to the original
    matrix. What happens when $\alpha>0$? What happens when
    $\alpha<0$? Can you find the value where the behaviour changes?
    Does that value depend on the matrix size?
