  The schemes we considered here are of first order in time and second
  order in space: their discretization order are $O(\Delta t)+O(\Delta
  x^2)$. Derive the \indexterm{Crank-Nicolson method} that is obtained
  by averaging the explicit and implicit schemes, show that it is
  unconditionally stable, and of second order in time.
