  Compare the data locality of the dense matrix-vector product, executed by rows,
  with the sparse product given just now. Show that, for general sparse matrices,
  the spatial locality in addressing\index{sparse!matrix-vector product!locality in}
  the input vector~$x$ has now disappeared. Are there matrix structures for which
  you can still expect some spatial locality?
