  You saw that a red-black ordering of unknowns
  coupled with the regular five-point star stencil give two subsets of
  variables that are not connected among themselves, that is,
  they form a two-colouring of the matrix graph.
  Can you find a colouring if nodes are connected by the second stencil in
  figure~\ref{fig:stencils}?
