  Take a square domain and a partitioning of the variables of the
  processors as in figure~\ref{fig:laplaceparallel}.
  What is the maximum number of neighbours a
  processor needs to communication with for the box stencil in
  figure~\ref{fig:stencils}? In three space dimensions, what is the
  number of neighbours if a 7-point central difference stencil is
  used?
