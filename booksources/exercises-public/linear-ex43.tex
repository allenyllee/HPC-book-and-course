  Let $A$ be the matrix of the Poisson equation, $LU$~an incomplete
  factorization, and $R=A-LU$. Show that $R$ is a bi-diagonal matrix:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Consider that $R$ consists of those elements that are
    discarded during the factorization. Where are they located in the
    matrix?
  \item Alternatively, write out the sparsity pattern of the
    product~$LU$ and compare that to the sparsity pattern of~$A$.
  \end{itemize}
