  Consider the regular right-looking Gaussian elimination
\begin{verbatim}
for k=1..n
  p = 1/a(k,k)
  for i=k+1,n
    for j=k+1,n
      a(i,j) = a(i,j)-a(i,k)*p*a(k,j)
\end{verbatim}
  Analyze the running time, speedup, and efficiency as a function
  of~$N$, if we assume a one-dimensional distribution, and enough
  processors to store one column per processor. Show that speedup is
  limited.

  Also perform this analysis for a two-dimensional decomposition where
  each processor stores one element.
