  Suppose that we apply the \ac{GS} algorithm to the columns of a
  rectangular matrix~$A$, giving a matrix~$Q$. Prove that there is an
  upper triangular matrix~$R$ such that $A=QR$. (Hint: look at the
  $c_{ji}$ coefficients above.) If we normalize the
  orthogonal vector in the algorithm above, $Q$~has the additional property
  that $Q^tQ=I$. Prove this too.
