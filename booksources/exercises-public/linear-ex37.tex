  In linear algebra classes, you typically look at matrix properties
  and whether they are invariant under a change of basis, in
  particular under \indexterm{unitary basis transformations}:
  \[ B = VAV^t,\quad\hbox{where $VV^t=I$.} \]
  Show that a
  symmetric permutation a particular change of basis is. Name some
  matrix properties that do not change under unitary transformations.
