  The above algorithm for determining the communication part of the
  sparse matrix-vector product can be made far more efficient if we
  assume a matrix that is \indexterm{structurally symmetric}:
  $a_{ij}\not=0\Leftrightarrow a_{ji}\not=0$. Show that in this case
  no communication is needed to determine the communication pattern.
