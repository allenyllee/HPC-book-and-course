  Show that an $n\times n$ linear system $Ax=b$ over the complex numbers
  can be written as a $2n\times 2n$ system over the real
  numbers. Hint: split the matrix and the vectors in their real and
  imaginary parts. Argue for the efficiency of storing arrays of
  complex numbers as separate arrays for the real and imaginary parts.
