  Consider the following pseudocode of an algorithm for summing $n$
  numbers $x[i]$ where $n$ is a power of~2:
\begin{verbatim}
for s=2,4,8,...,n/2,n:
  for i=0 to n-1 with steps s:
    x[i] = x[i] + x[i+s/2]
sum = x[0]
\end{verbatim}
  Analyze the spatial and temporal locality of this algorithm, and
  contrast it with the standard algorithm
\begin{verbatim}
sum = 0
for i=0,1,2,...,n-1
  sum = sum + x[i]
\end{verbatim}
