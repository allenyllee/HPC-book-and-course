  Considering the graph of airports and the routes that exist between
  them. If there are only hubs and non-hubs, argue that deleting a
  non-hub has no effect on shortest paths between other airports. On
  the other hand, consider the nodes ordered in a two-dimensional
  grid, and delete an arbitrary node. How many shortest paths are affected?
