  Consider the case of summing 8 elements with 4 processors. Show that
  some of the edges in the graph of figure~\ref{fig:par-sum-graph} no
  longer correspond to actual communications.
  %
  Now consider summing 16 elements with, again, 4 processors. What is
  the number of communication edges this time?
