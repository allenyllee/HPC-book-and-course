  The above code fragment is efficient if the matrix is dense inside
  the band. This is not the case for, for instance, the matrix of
  two-dimensional \acp{BVP}; see section~\ref{sec:2dbvp} and in
  particular equation~\eqref{eq:5starmatrix}. Write code for the
  matrix-vector product by diagonals that only
  uses the nonzero diagonals.
