  Consider the assignment of processes to processors, where the
  structure of the problem is such that
  each processes only communicates with its
  nearest neighbours, and let processors be ordered in a
  two-dimensional grid. If we do the obvious assignment of the process
  grid to the processor grid, there will be no contention. Now write a
  program that assigns processes to random processors, and evaluate
  how much contention there will be.
