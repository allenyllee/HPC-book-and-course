  The matrix from a two-dimensional \ac{BVP} has a block tridiagonal
  structure. Divide the domain in four strips, that is, using three
  separators (see figure~\ref{fig:domdecomp4}). Note that the
  separators are uncoupled in the original matrix.

  Now sketch the sparsity structure of the resulting system on the
  separators are elimination of the subdomains. Show that the system
  is block tridiagonal.
