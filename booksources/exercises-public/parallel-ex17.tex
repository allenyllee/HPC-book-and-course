For both the simple cross bar and the butterfly
exchange, the network needs to be expanded as the number of processors grows.
Give the number of wires (of some unit length) and the number of switching
elements that is needed in both cases to connect~$n$ processors and memories.
What is the time that a data packet needs to go from memory to processor,
expressed in the unit time that it takes to traverse a unit length of wire
and the time to traverse a switching element?
