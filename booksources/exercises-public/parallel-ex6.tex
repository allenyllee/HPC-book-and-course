  Discuss choosing the right granularity for a data parallel operation
  such as averaging on a two-dimensional grid. Show that there is a
  \indexterm{surface-to-volume} effect: the amount of communication is
  of a lower order than the computation. This means that, even if
  communication is much slower than computation, increasing the task
  size will still give a balanced execution.
