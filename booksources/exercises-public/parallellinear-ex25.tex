  Let $A$ be the matrix
  \begin{equation} A=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    a_{11}&&\emptyset\\ a_{21}&a_{22}\\ &\ddots&\ddots\\
    \emptyset&&a_{n,n-1}&a_{nn}
  \end{pmatrix}.\label{eq:ex:bidiagonal}
  \end{equation}
  Show that the matrix vector product $y\leftarrow Ax$ and the system
  solution $x\leftarrow A\inv y$, obtained by solving the
    triangular system $Ax=y$, not by inverting~$A$, have the same
  operation count.

  Now consider parallelizing the product $y\leftarrow Ax$. Suppose we
  have $n$ processors, and each processor~$i$ stores $x_i$ and the
  $i$-th row of~$A$. Show that the product $Ax$ can be computed without
  idle time on any processor but the first.

  Can the same be done for the solution of the triangular system
  $Ax=y$? Show that the straightforward implementation has every
  processor idle for an $(n-1)/n$ fraction of the computation.
