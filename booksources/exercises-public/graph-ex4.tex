  Let $G=\langle V,E\rangle$ be an undirected graph, and let $G'=\langle
  V,E'\rangle$ be the graph with the same vertices, but with vertices
  defined by
  \[ (i,j)\in E'\Leftrightarrow \exists_k\colon (i,k)\in E\wedge
  (k,j)\in E. \]
  If $M$ is the adjacency matrix of~$G$, show that $M^2$ is the
  adjacency matrix of~$G'$, where we use boolean multiplication on the
  elements: $1\cdot1=1$, $1+1=1$.
