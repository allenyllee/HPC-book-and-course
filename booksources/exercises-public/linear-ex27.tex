  \label{ex:reducible-tridiagonal}
  Take again the matrix from the previous exercise, and zero the
  offdiagonal elements closest to the `middle' of the matrix: let
  $a_{(n+1)/2,(n+1)/2+1}=a_{(n+1)/2+1,(n+1)/2}=0$. Describe what that
  does to the graph of~$A$. Such a graph is called
  \indexterm{reducible}. Now apply the permuation of the previous
  exercise and sketch the resulting sparsity pattern. Note that the
  reducibility of the graph is now harder to read from the sparsity
  pattern.
