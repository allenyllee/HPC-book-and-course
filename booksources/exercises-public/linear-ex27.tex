  \label{ex:rb-tridiagonal}
  Let $A$ be the tridiagonal matrix of the one-dimensional \ac{BVP}
  (see section~\ref{sec:1dbvp}) of size~$n$ with $n$~odd. What does
  the graph of~$A$ look like?  Consider the permutation that results
  from putting the nodes in the following sequence:
  $1,3,5,\ldots,n,2,4,\allowbreak6,\ldots,\allowbreak n-\nobreak
  1$. What does the sparsity pattern of the permuted matrix look like?
  Renumbering strategies such as this will be discussed in more detail
  in section~\ref{sec:redblackgreen}.
