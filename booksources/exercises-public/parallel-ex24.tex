  Make this notion precise. Suppose a parallel task takes time~1 on
  all processors but one.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Let $0<\alpha<1$ and let one processor take time
    $1+\alpha$. What is the speedup and efficiency as function of the
    number of processors? Consider this both in the Amdahl and
    Gustafsson sense (section~\ref{sec:amdahl}).
  \item Answer the same questions if one processor takes time $1-\alpha$.
  \end{itemize}
