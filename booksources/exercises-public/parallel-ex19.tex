  Show that this algorithm ignores some serious issues about memory
  usage:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If the matrix is kept in shared memory, how many simultaneous
    reads from each memory locations are performed?
  \item If the processors keep the input and output to the local
    computations in  local storage, how much duplication
    is there of the matrix elements?
  \end{itemize}
