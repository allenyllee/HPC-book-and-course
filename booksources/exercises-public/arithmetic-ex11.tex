  Program a simulator for decimal $d$-digit arithmetic and experiment with the
  accuracy of the two ways of computing the solution of a quadratic
  equation. Simulating $d$-digit decimal arithmetic can be done as
  follows. Let $x$ be a floating point number, then:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Normalize $x$ by finding an integer $e$ such that
    $x'\mathrel{:=} |x|\cdot 10^e\in[.1,1)$.
    \item Now truncate this number to $d$ digits by
      multiplying $x'$ by $10^d$, truncating the result to an integer,
      and multiplying that result again by~$10^{-d}$.
    \item Multiply this truncated number by~$10^{-e}$ to revert the
      normalization.
  \end{itemize}
