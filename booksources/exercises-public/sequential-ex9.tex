  Consider two processors, a data item $x$ in memory, and cachelines
  $x_1$,$x_2$ in the private caches of the two processors to which $x$
  is mapped. Describe the transitions between the states of $x_1$ and
  $x_2$ under reads and writes of~$x$ on the two processors. Also
  indicate which actions cause memory bandwidth to be used. (This list
  of transitions is a \indexacf{FSA}; see section~\ref{app:fsa}.)
