  Let us take a look at what happens with a matrix~$A$ when the nodes
  of its graph $G=\langle V,E,W\rangle$ are renumbered. As a simple example,
  we number the nodes backwards; that is, with $n$ the number of
  nodes, we map node~$i$ to $n+1-i$.
  Correspondingly, we find a new graph
  $G'=\langle V,E',W'\rangle$ where
  \[ (i,j)\in E'\Leftrightarrow (n+1-i,n+1-j)\in E,\qquad
  w'_{ij}=w_{n+1-i,n+1-j}.\]
  What does this renumbering imply for the matrix~$A'$ that
  corresponds to~$G'$? If you exchange the labels $i,j$ on two nodes,
  what is the effect on the matrix~$A$?
