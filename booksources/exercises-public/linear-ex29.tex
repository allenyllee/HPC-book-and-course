  Prove the generalization of the above argument about eliminating a
  single vertex. Let $I\subset V$ be any set of
  vertices, and let $J$ be the vertices connected to~$I$:
  \[ J\cap I=\emptyset,\quad \forall_{i\in I}\exists_{j\in J}\colon (i,j)\in
  E. \]
  Now show that eliminating the variables in~$I$ leads to a graph
  $\langle V',E'\rangle$ where all nodes in~$J$ are connected in the
  remaining graph, if there was a path between them through~$I$:
  \[ \forall_{j_1,j_2\in J}\colon \hbox{there is a path
    $j_i\rightarrow j_2$ through $I$ in $E$} \Rightarrow
    (j_1,j_2)\in E'.
  \]
