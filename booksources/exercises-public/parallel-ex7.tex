Let's say there are $t$ threads, and your code looks like
\begin{verbatim}
for (i=0; i<N; i++) {
  a[i] = // some calculation
}
\end{verbatim}
If you specify a chunksize of~1,
iterations $0,t,2t,\ldots$ go to the first thread,
$1,1+t,1+2t,\ldots$ to the second, et cetera. Discuss why this is a bad
strategy from a performance point of view. Hint: look up the definition of
\indexterm{false sharing}. What would be a good chunksize?
